API Extraction → BeautifulSoup → SQL Data Analysis

In this section, I demonstrate my ability to extract, analyze, and interpret data using APIs and web scraping techniques with BeautifulSoup. The retrieved data is processed and analyzed in SQL to uncover meaningful insights. By integrating these tools, I efficiently collect both structured and unstructured data, clean and transform it, and apply various analytical techniques to derive valuable conclusions. This project highlights my proficiency in data extraction, database management, and analytical reasoning, showcasing my ability to work with real-world datasets to generate actionable insights.
